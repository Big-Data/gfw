    <p>Logging within Cameroon’s forest estate occurs within designated areas called Forest Management Units (FMUs).  This dataset represents the spatial limits of FMUs within Cameroon’s permanent forest estate.  There are 114 FMUs in Cameroon which are further divided into logging concessions called annual allowable cuts (AACs), where selective logging is permitted. There are 2988 concessions within Cameroon’s FMU system. These logging permits require owners and operators to maintain permanent forest cover.</p>

<p>The Intact Forest Landscapes dataset identifies unbroken expanses of natural ecosystems within the zone of current forest extent (as of 2000), mapped from Landsat satellite imagery. These landscapes show no signs of significant human activity, are not fragmented by infrastructure, and are at least 50,000 hectares in size.  These data can be used for assessment of forest intactness, alteration and degradation at global and regional scales.
